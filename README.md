For NVIM v0.11.3
Windows 10/11

Ideas:
- Toggle color plugins from a list of colorschemes
- Integrate features from kickstart and neovim distros
- Add deleting of autobracket when deleting the first character
- make autobracket function more efficient to just pass a list of brackets and quotation marks I want to auto bracket, also add \<\>
- Create keymapsfunctions.lua file
- Fix autobracket indent to indent more when already in an indented section
- Find keybind to go to the end of a line in insert mode

Finished:
- For autobracket pressing enter between two brackets creates a newline in the middle
- Find or create a keymap to automatically create a newline in insert like how o works in normal mode
